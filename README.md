�
Solution

Try another executor from compatible list
Restart Roblox and try again
Check internet - active connection required
�

🔑 "Invalid API Key" / "API Error 400"

Copied completely (usually 39 characters)
No spaces at start/end
Get new key:
Go to aistudio.google.com/apikey

Wait a few minutes if exceeded limit
�

⏱️ "Rate limit reached" / Error 429
�
Solution
What is this? You exceeded API request limit
Automatic solution:
Script will auto-switch to another model
Just wait for message
Manual solution:
Wait 1-2 minutes
Or add new API key in settings
Or switch to Lite model (fewer limits)
Gemini API Limits (free tier):
15 requests per minute (RPM)
1 million tokens per day

�

💾 Chat history doesn't save
�
Solution
Check executor functions:
print(writefile) -- Should output: function
print(readfile)  -- Should output: function
Write permissions:
Some executors require permissions
Check executor settings
Try another executor:
JJSploit often doesn't support saving
Use KRNL, Fluxus or others
Clear cache:
Delete GeminiAI_Data.json file (if exists)
Restart script
�

🖼️ Button doesn't appear
�
Solution
Wait for loading - may take 5-10 seconds
Check other corners - button might be off-screen
Restart script
Check console for errors (F9 in Roblox)
�

🌐 Language/theme doesn't change
�
Solution
This is normal! When changing language or theme:
GUI is completely recreated
You return to main screen
This is done for proper application of changes
Your data is saved:
Chat history ✅
API keys ✅
Selected model ✅
�

📱 Other Issues
�
Common problem solutions
Problem: AI responds in English instead of another language
Solution: Change language in settings affects only UI, not AI responses. For responses in your language, write in that language!
Problem: Takes long to respond/no response
Solution: Pro models think longer. Switch to Flash or Lite model
Problem: "Unexpected response format" error
Solution: Try another model, some experimental models are unstable
Problem: Script closes when clicking ❌
Solution: This is normal! ❌ closes GUI and returns to API key input. For minimize use —
